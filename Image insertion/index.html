served as principal scientific adviser (1999–2001) to the government with the rank of cabinet minister. 
</p></li>

 Kalam as a national hero, although the tests caused great concern in the international community.</p></li>
<li><p style="color:Black;font-family:Georgia;">He was president of India from 2002 to 2007.</p></li>
<li><p style="color:Black;font-family:Georgia;">Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam had always encouraged people to strive towards 
incorporating new values, ethics and learnings in their day-to-day lives.</p></li>
<li><p style="color:Black;font-family:Georgia;">His contribution in the scientific development sector, and his devotion 
towards serving the nation, will forever be remembered by one and all.</p></li>
<li><p style="color:Black;font-family:Georgia;">He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998,
 the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.</p></li>
